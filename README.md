# ETDPortal

ETDPortal software is a scalable repository service application for creating repository federated services. It is developed and maintained by the [Digital Libraries Laboratory](http://dl.cs.uct.ac.za) at the [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za).
There are presently two know live deployment instances: The South African [National ETD Portal](http://www.netd.ac.za) and the global [NDLTD Union Archive](http://union.ndltd.org).
